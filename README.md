# ProcessOptimizationProject_2025
Optimized hydroformylation in a CSTR by identifying optimal conditions (temperature, pressure, concentrations) to maximize product yield. Used SLSQP via scipy.optimize and implemented MINLP in Pyomo, solved with BONMIN to select the best syngas mixture from three options.
